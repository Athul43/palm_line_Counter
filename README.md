üèÜ Achievements

ü•á Won 1st Place (Best Project Award) at the ThinkerHub ‚ÄúUseless Projects‚Äù Hackathon ‚Äì Mar Athanasius College of Engineering.
Project: Thel Palmline Counter ‚Äî recognized for its creativity, humor, and absolute uselessness that made perfect sense!
  

### Project Description
Palmline Counter is a completely useless (yet delightfully absurd) web app that pretends to count the number of lines in your palm and generates a fake personality certificate based on it. Powered by questionable AI and backed by even more questionable science, it‚Äôs the future of palm reading‚Äîtoday!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People often wonder what their palm lines say about them. But in an age of AI, why trust an actual human when you can trust a random line counter on a website?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Just upload a palm image and let our cutting-edge (not really) system ‚Äúanalyze‚Äù your hand. Then, receive a certificate that confidently tells you who you are, how many lives you‚Äôll have, or if you're secretly a lizard.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Frontend: HTML , CSS , JavaScript
- Backend:python Flask
- Flask
- Libraries used
  html2canvas (to capture fake certificate screenshots)

  Flask for routing and image handling

  Random.js logic for fake predictions

  Hosting on Replit / GitHub Pages
